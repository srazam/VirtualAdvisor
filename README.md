# VirtualAdvisor
Created for Hack NC 2023

- A virtual advisor where based off the student's past/current courses, interest, how many credit hours they want to take next semester, and the semester they are planning for, the virtual adisor will provide a list of all classes that the student still needs to take as well as suggestions for specifically what classes they should take during the next semester
- The unique part of this program is that it will take into account whether the student is part time/full time and also will keep track of when exactly you can take courses depending on the semester
