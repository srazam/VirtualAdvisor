# VirtualAdvisor
Created for Hack NC 2023

- A virtual advisor where based off the student's past/current courses, interest, how many credit hours they want to take next semester, and the semester they are planning for, the virtual adisor w provide a list of all classes that the student still needs to take as well as suggestions for specifically what classes they should take during the next semester
- Instead of just displaying which classes you have left to take for your major, this program suggests classes for a desired semester based on what you have already taken
- The program also takes into account desired semester hours and also will keep track of when exactly you can take courses depending on the semester
- It calculates and outputs the estimated difficulty level of the suggested semester by averaging scores pulled from Rate My Professor
