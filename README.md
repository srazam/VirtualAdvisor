# VirtualAdvisor
### Created for Hack NC 2023

- All college students must register for classes, but advisors are not always around or available
- Virtual Advisor is your go-to preliminary advisor, providing a list of core and Gen Ed classes and suggesting classes that you need to take
- Virtual Advisor goes beyond typical registration software; instead of just displaying which classes you have left for your major, Virtual Advisor suggests courses for the upcoming semester, taking into account classes taken, desired number of credit hours, semesters the courses are offered, and pre-requisites and co-requisites
- After entering your interests, Virtual Advisor will even suggest Gen Ed courses that you may enjoy``
- As a bonus capability, Virtual Advisor calculates and outputs the estimated difficulty level of the suggested semester by averaging scores pulled from Rate My Professors

- This Virtual Advisor prototype utilizes the Computer Science major at East Carolina University and a sample of various Gen Eds from across campus
- Ideally, a finalized version would be integrated into a university's student data course database, however, we have hardcoded an example based on our current classes
- A mock-up of the user interface can be found [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFylO-LAyM/MiuBaxIas0DK82G4m40i8g/view?utm_content=DAFylO-LAyM&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor) to provide viewers an idea of how future users may interact with the software
